Run-Away is a Three-Dimensional Racing Game developed using Three.js Javascript Library which sees the User controlling a Runner on 
a track as he avoid the obstacles aiming for the high score. 

## Technology Stack

1. Three.js Javascript Library 

Three.js an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer. The library also provides Canvas 2D, SVG and CSS3D renderers. This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a `WebGL` renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the `document.body` element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.

```javascript
var camera, scene, renderer;
var geometry, material, mesh;

init();
animate();

function init() {

	camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.01, 10 );
	camera.position.z = 1;

	scene = new THREE.Scene();

	geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
	material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

	mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
	scene.add( mesh );

	renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
	renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
	document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

}

function animate() {

	requestAnimationFrame( animate );


	mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
	mesh.rotation.y += 0.02;

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}
```
2. Javascript

 JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
 
 3. Hyper-Text Markup Language
 
 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

4. Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
